 	The newest offering from the British progressive rock band Haken, Affinity is a powerhouse of progressive ingenuity and wonderful song writing that will leave you singing the tunes and riffing the riffs in your head for days after listening. A follow up to their album "The Mountain", Affinity takes elements from the previous album and creates an enhanced version of their sound with the likes of "1985" where they mix synth and pop sounds from the 1980's to create an amalgam of sound that harkens back to the decades of mullets and LPs. Overall, I would rate this album a 4.5. It is the Haken sound, distilled and presented in an amazing way.
