 	I just took another listen to this progressive metal masterpiece from the legendary Symphony X, and I can tell you that it only gets better with every listen. With every lyric belted out by vocallist Russel Allan, you can feel that same energy that was present when the band was first formed in 1994. Beginning with the powerful "Nevermore", where the ever-inventive rythm guitars chugg along vivaciously, to the beautful "Swan Song", with its soaring melodies, this album has a range that is expected of every Symphony X album. Overall, I would give this album a 4/5. A solid offering from the band, a welcome addition to every Symphony X fan's collection.
