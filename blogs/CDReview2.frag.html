<p>
 	This is the album that really brought Weird Al back to the mainstream in a big way. Each song masterfully done in a way that is to be expected from the veteran parody musician, whose 30 years of experience playfully imitating the popular music of the time has honed his abilites to a level unlike anyone else. "Tacky" has got to be my favorite track on the whole album, especially if you get a chance to watch the video that accompanied the release of this album; comedy perfection. Overall, I would give this album a 5/5. Each track is strong, I don't seem to be able to find a weakness in any of it.
